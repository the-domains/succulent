### Call us now on 03 6234 0600

### Welcome to Hobart's premium events and conference venue. Since its inception in 1999, the Hobart Function and Conference Centre has been the location of thousands of events including weddings, conferences, gala dinners, product launches, training sessions, work functions and more.

The venue enjoys a waterfront location like no other, situated as it is on Elizabeth Street Pier, spanning 100m out over the sparkling water of the Derwent, the centerpiece of Hobart's bustling waterfront community.

Each of the six amazing event spaces boast floor to ceiling windows so delegates and guests enjoy Hobart's wonderfully clear natural light, or at night, the bobbing lights of boats in the harbour.

We can also cater for large offsite dinners or other events. We're especially proud to be the preferred caterers for events at Princes Wharf No. 1 Shed, just 200 metres across the water from us on Hobart's historic waterfront. [**Click here for more details on Princes Wharf events**.][0]
